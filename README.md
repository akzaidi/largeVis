largeVis
================

This is an implementation of the `largeVis` algorithm described in (<https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00370>). It also incorporates code for a very fast algorithm for estimating k-nearest neighbors.

The kNN code is tested and works very well. The code for projecting a kNN matrix into a low-dimensional embedding is not fully tested.

This package is under development.
