#' Find approximate k-Nearest Neighbors using random projection tree search.
#'
#' A fast and accurate algorithm for finding approximate k-nearest neighbors.
#'
#' Note that the algorithm does not guarantee that it will find K neighbors for each node. A
#' warning will be issued if it finds fewer neighbors than requested. If the input data contains
#' distinct partitionable clusters, try increasing the \code{tree_threshold} to increase the number
#' of returned neighbors.
#'
#' @param x A matrix.
#' @param K How many nearest neighbors to seek for each node.
#' @param n_trees The number of trees to build.
#' @param tree_threshold The threshold for creating a new branch.  The paper authors suggest
#' using a value equivalent to the number of features in the input set.
#' @param max_iter Number of iterations in the neighborhood exploration phase.
#' @param max_depth The maximum level of recursion.
#' @param verbose Whether to print verbose logging using the \code{progress} package.
#'
#' @return A [K, N] matrix of the approximate K nearest neighbors for each vertex.
